Apologies if anyone else has already explained this, but I just figured this out. In the latest version of ZMK you can load custom 1-bit art to display on the right keyboard half. The below steps assume you're comfortable building ZMK from source. The steps are as follows:

First, get the latest ZMK code using git pull
Find a piece of 1-bit art to use or make your own and scale to a resolution of 68x140.
Rotate the art 90 degrees clockwise and save as a monochrome bitmap.
Load the bitmap into the online LVGL Image Converter using color format of CF_INDEXED_1BIT and outputting as a C array.
Open the resulting C file and copy everything AFTER the #ifndef LV_ATTRIBUTE_MEM_ALIGN block.
Paste code you copied into the bottom of app\boards\shields\nice_view\widgets\art.c
Find <file name>_map[] = { and replace the two color index lines with the following copied from the "mountain" or "balloon" images where "<file name>" is the name you put into the Image Converter:

#if CONFIG_NICE_VIEW_WIDGET_INVERTED
        0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, /*Color of index 0*/
        0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff, /*Color of index 1*/
#else
        0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xff, /*Color of index 0*/
        0xff, 0xff, 0xff, 0xff, /*Color of index 1*/
#endif
Open the file app\boards\shields\nice_view\widgets\peripheral_status.c and add a line for your new art like LV_IMG_DECLARE(<file name>); near the top.
In the same file, search for lv_img_set_src(art, random ? &balloon : &mountain); and edit to be lv_img_set_src(art, &<file name>);
Now rebuild and reflash the firmware.
